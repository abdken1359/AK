            <ContentBlogUtilsBlogHeading heading="How It started"/>
            
            <ContentBlogUtilsBlogText> In my childhood, I was indecisive about my career plan. I was finding myself switching career plans often. At the age of 15, I took my final decision, and aimed to become a Programmer.</ContentBlogUtilsBlogText>
           
            <ContentBlogUtilsBlogText>At that age, I was amazed by video games, especially the graphics, the interactivity, and the user friendly features of these games. At the time, I didn't know much of terms used in IT such as <b>Frontend development, Software Engineering, etc</b>. I decided to start learning a programming language, and wrote my first <em>Hello world</em> program in 
            <b>C</b>, in my first IDE, <b>Codeblocks</b>. Of course, I did find it hard at the begining, and made a lot of errors; but as time passed, I got used to the language, and made basic programs myself, like a simple arithmetic program, a report card program which calculates student average, etc. I was really fascinated by C, until I came across C++.

            I instantly loved C++ when I started learning it on w3Schools. I found it's syntax a little bit clearer than that of C. Unfortunately, my vibe for C++ vanished slowly but surely over time, leading to a new void in me.
             I became confused on what to learn, so I gave HTML a chance, which I didn't regret. 
             Mastering HTML was the beginning of my very long Journey of Web development. 
             After Learning HTML, I barely learned CSS at first, before moving to CSS frameworks like W3CSS, UIKIT CSS, and Materialize CSS.
              After getting enough knowledge on CSS frameworks, I moved to Javascript. Javascript was definitely the hardest language to learn for me. It was very difficult for me to understand the language, but I didn't give up. 
              I tried hard to learn the Javascript gradually, by watching tutorials on youtube, and reading articles on Freecodecamp and DEVto. I later learned Vue, and really enjoyed it's simplicity and slow learning curve.

            Although I'm not yet a Senior Frontend Developer, I continue to learn and improve by reflecting on my past mistakes.
