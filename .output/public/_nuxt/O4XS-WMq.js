I became confused on what to learn, so I gave HTML a chance, which I didn't regret. Mastering HTML was the beginning of my very long Journey of Web development. After Learning HTML, I barely learned CSS at first, before moving to CSS frameworks like W3CSS, UIKIT CSS, and Materialize CSS. After getting enough knowledge on CSS frameworks, I moved to Javascript. Javascript was definitely the hardest language to learn for me. It was very difficult for me to understand the language, but I didn't give up. I tried hard to learn the Javascript gradually, by watching tutorials on youtube, and reading articles on Freecodecamp and DEVto. I later learned Vue, and really enjoyed it's simplicity and slow learning curve.
